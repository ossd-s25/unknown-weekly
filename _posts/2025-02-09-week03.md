title: Week 3 - Chrome Extension
---

Our team is making a Google Chrome extension called Color1ze. Inspired by a daydream of Nyan Cat, Color1ze is a gag extension that changes the default color of text on a website to a flashy rainbow. Since our team is mainly comprised of members with little JavaScript experience, our goal was more so to build something fun than to build something useful.

Candidly, we have not made much progress towards the extension. Outside of doing some research on how to implement our idea via content scripts, we’ve planned our meeting to work on the extension for tomorrow. Nevertheless, we’ve split up the work into manageable and parallel chunks so far. I usually find this the hardest part of group work, but our team has managed this well.
