title: Week 1: Open Source Is Good
---


Open source is great because it makes software cheaper.

In a 2024 Harvard Business School paper, researchers estimated that firms would spend 3.5 times more to build software were in not for open source software (OSS) [0]. This is good news to more than just MBA-types. This is also good news to us, regular consumers, because the relationship between software costs and software output is superlinear: cheaper software leads to more software [1]. As an optimistic software engineer, this means being able to solve more problems with fewer bugs given the same time and budget. As a result, I think OSS makes our world more fruitful.

Disappointingly, OSS is often overlooked because it is viewed of as "free." This is a significant downside to the open-source model. While projects and companies become dependent on open-source packages, they rarely contribute back engineer hours or provide monetary support. As a result, critical, yet under-resourced packages become vulnerable to malicious attacks. For example, a recent widely-known example is the hijacking of xzutils by "Jia Tan" [2]. However, recent trends such as bounties and sponsorships are steps in the right direction.

Just like big corporations, I too rely on a great deal of OSS, my recent favorites being Ghostty and Neovim (which I used to write this) and Rust and React. I'm also part of the problem-- I rarely contribute back. My hope with taking this class is to change that.
